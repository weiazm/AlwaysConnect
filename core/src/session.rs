//! Session driver (DESIGN.md §6): what to do after a drop, and what to do
//! when re-authentication needs the user.
//!
//! Verified ground this module stands on (corrected 2026-10-30):
//! - CORRECTION: an earlier version of these docs claimed the public C API
//!   had no cookie-injection setter, based on a secondary API summary that
//!   omitted it. That was wrong. The local 9.12 header itself declares it
//!   (`/usr/include/openconnect.h:669`):
//!   `int openconnect_set_cookie(struct openconnect_info *, const char *);`
//!   plus `openconnect_clear_cookie()` (:670). The header is authoritative;
//!   the summary was not. The binding lives in `openconnect.rs`
//!   (`VpnSession::set_cookie` / `clear_cookie`).
//! - Consequence, corrected: a fresh process CAN resume from a saved
//!   cookie through the library path (set_cookie, then connect) — the
//!   saved `SessionRecord` is usable by both the library route and the
//!   CLI/Helper route (--cookie-on-stdin). In-process recovery (live
//!   vpninfo, mainloop reconnect) is still the fastest path for a quick
//!   drop; a rejected or expired cookie falls back to full
//!   re-authentication, with approval wait when the gateway demands it.
//! - The driver never guesses cookie expiry: validity is proven only by
//!   the server's response to a reconnect attempt, never by a timer.
//!
//! State machine extensions (added here, tested below): the original
//! machine had no terminal path for a rejected authentication and no
//! manual-disconnect path from Connecting/Authenticating. Both are needed
//! by a user-facing driver, so `state_machine` gains `AuthRejected`
//! (Authenticating -> Disconnected) and ManualDisconnect from Connecting
//! and Authenticating.
